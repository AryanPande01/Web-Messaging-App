You are a senior full-stack software engineer and system architect.

buid with:
MERN Stack (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
Socket.IO for real-time messaging
MongoDB Atlas for storage

your task is to build this a best social messenging app project.
best ui and theme , nice best asthetic ui, give the best possible ui to the app with dark theme.
and a smooth flow eg person1 seraches person 2 , send him friend request, person 2 recieves request he accepts it , and then they can chat with each other ,for now only chat not photo video.
all person get proper notifiction in ther notification box that yuo request is approved or declined etc

🎯 GOALS
Make this project strong enough for resumes and interviews
Follow industry-level architecture and best practices
Keep the UI modern and intuitive
Maintain scalability, security, and clean code

🔐 AUTHENTICATION & USER SYSTEM (REQUIRED)
Implement two authentication methods:
Google OAuth Login
Save  user info in MongoDB
Handle existing vs new users correctly
Normal Login / Signup
User ID (username or email) + password
Password hashing with bcrypt
JWT-based authentication
Protected routes (frontend + backend)

User schema must include:
name
username
email
password (hashed)
profile picture
friends list
pending friend requests (sent & received)
blocked users
settings (theme, privacy, etc.)
timestamps

🧭 NAVBAR & CORE UI (REQUIRED)
Create a persistent navbar with icons/tabs for:
Profile
Chats
Friend List
Search Users
Friend Requests (Pending)
Notifications
Groups
Settings
Use clean UI patterns similar to Instagram / WhatsApp Web.

👥 FRIEND SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔍 Search Users

User can search for other registered users
Only show users who exist in MongoDB
While searching:
Show mutual friends count
Show mutual friends list (like Instagram)

➕ Friend Request Flow
User A searches User B
User A sends friend request
User B sees it in Pending Requests
User B can:
✅ Accept → both become friends, chat enabled

❌ Decline → User A gets a notification

🔔 Notifications
Friend request accepted/declined
Real-time notification using Socket.IO
Notification dropdown/tab in navbar

💬 CHAT SYSTEM (EXTEND EXISTING)
One-to-one chat only between friends
Real-time messaging (Socket.IO)
Message status:
Sent
Delivered
Seen
Typing indicators
Online/offline presence
Chat list sorted by latest activity

👨‍👩‍👧 GROUP CHAT SYSTEM
➕ Create Group

Group creator selects members from friend list
Group has:
Name
Group image
Admin(s)

💬 Group Chat

Real-time group messaging
Admin permissions:
Add/remove members
Change group info
System messages (user joined/left)

🌟 SUGGESTIONS & DISCOVERY

Suggested Users tab
Show users based on:
Mutual friends
Recently joined users
Suggestion logic should be backend-driven

⚙️ SETTINGS PAGE (INSPIRED BY INSTAGRAM)

Include:
Dark Mode / Light Mode (persist in DB)
Blocked Users list
Privacy options
Logout
Account info
Blocked users:
Cannot send messages
Cannot send friend requests
Hidden from search

🧠 ARCHITECTURE & CODE QUALITY (MANDATORY)

You MUST:
Follow MVC pattern properly
Separate:
Controllers
Services
Models
Routes

Socket logic
Use reusable React components
Use React Context or Redux where appropriate
Use environment variables
Handle errors globally
Add meaningful comments
Avoid hardcoding values

🛡️ SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES

JWT authentication middleware
Route protection
Input validation
Proper error handling
Secure Socket.IO authentication
MongoDB indexing where necessary

🧪 OPTIONAL BUT IMPRESSIVE (IF TIME ALLOWS)

If possible, also add:
Message reactions
Message delete (for me / for everyone)
Profile status (About / Bio)
Last seen
Read receipts toggle
API documentation (Swagger or Markdown)

📦 FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION
You should:

Explain what you changed and why
Provide:
Updated folder structure
Backend APIs
Socket event flow
Frontend component breakdown
Ensure the app runs without breaking existing features

🧾 IMPORTANT NOTE
This project is meant for:
Resume
Portfolio
Technical interviews
So prioritize:
Clean architecture
Real-world logic
Scalability
Professional coding standards

🚀 START BY:

Reviewing the existing codebase
Proposing a feature-wise implementation plan
Then implementing features step-by-step

also in the end , make sure that the mongo db url is taken form the env file, i will update the env file with my monog db api key.
